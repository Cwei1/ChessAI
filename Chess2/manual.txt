If you type in something in the incorrect format
or an invalid move the board will reprint itself
and say it is still your turn (no move will be made).


If you try to make a move that puts you in check
it will be invalid. If a player is in check a 
message will be printed, and that player must make 
a move to get out of check.
  

If checkmate has been reached in the game. A 
message will be printed notifying the winner,
and they will be asked if they would like to 
see a summary of the game.


If a pawn manages to reach the opponent's side
the player will be given the chance to 
upgrade it to something else.


This game follows all of the regular moves
of standard Chess. However castling is not
legal in this version.

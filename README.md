Description: Teaching a computer how to play chess at a level comparable to that of human beings or even better was a trivial computer science problem during the 1970s and 1980s. It was not until 1989 that a computer was able to sucessfully beat one of the best chess players in the world and in doing so usher in a new age in which the intelligence of chessAI's was greater than that of human beings. That is what we are trying to construct in this project. A Chess Aritifical Intelligence algorithm that is able to strategize in real-time and assess the best move possible (short-term benefits are secondary to long-term benefits.

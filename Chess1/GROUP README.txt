So guys I got checkmate working and the file read in thing
working. Cardy upload the gui so we can merge it.
The next part after that is to try and break the program so
we can fix bugs. Feel free to make the code more concise
I found out I had a bunch of garbage code in there that didn't
do anything. So yeah we are making progress.

Dionis:  me and Cardy discovered a problem 
with the pawn check in the game last night.
Apparently there seems to be some sort of 
a problem with when the pawn reaches the 
opponent's side and puts the king in check.
We tried to fix it but both of us are still
unsure of how this portion of the code works.
Look at the picture that I put in this 
directory.
